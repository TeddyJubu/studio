## üé® UX Principles Applied

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
Don't overwhelm users. Show options step-by-step:
- Quick actions first
- Then specific details
- Finally confirmation

### 2. Visual over Text
Replace typing with clicking:
- Calendar instead of "type a date"
- Time grid instead of "enter time"
- Buttons instead of "yes/no"

### 3. Error Prevention > Recovery
Validate as you go:
- Show only available dates
- Filter impossible times
- Prevent invalid party sizes

### 4. Clear Feedback
User should always know what's happening:
- Loading states
- Progress indicators
- Confirmation messages

### 5. Conversational, Not Robotic
Natural language processing:
- "Sounds great! And what time?" not "TIME_REQUIRED"
- Context awareness
- Empathetic responses
